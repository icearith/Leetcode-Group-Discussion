Design and implement a data structure for [Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU). It should support the following operations: `get` and `set`.

* `get(key)` - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
* `set(key, value)` - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
